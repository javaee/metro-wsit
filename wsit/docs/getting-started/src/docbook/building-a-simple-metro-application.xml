        <abstract>
            <para>The intent of this article is to demonstrate the steps
            required to build a web service starting both from Java code and
            from a WSDL document, to deploy that application into a web
            container, and to build a corresponding web service client
            application. In this example, the resulting application is
            portable across JAX-WS 2.0 implementations and do not use any
            Metro-specific technologies. It is intended as a baseline from
            which to develop your understanding of the larger Metro
            stack.</para>

        <title>Overview</title>

        <para>Supporting code samples are included to demonstrate building a
        JAX-WS web service in the Metro environment. The examples show how to
        develop a web service both starting from Java source code and starting
        from an existing WSDL document. For both scenarios, it shows how to
        develop a corresponding client application from the web service's WSDL
        document. Additional example shows how to use external web service metadata
        feature, which is necessary in case we are unable to use java annotations.
        The examples can be found below:</para>

            <para>The Java code and configuration files for the examples used
            in this document presume that the web container is listening on
            port 8080. Port 8080 is the default "listen" port for both
            GlassFish (<literal>domain1</literal>) and Tomcat. If you have
            changed the "listen" port, you will need to edit the example
            source files to account for that. The following is a list of the
            files which contain references to the "listen" port:</para>

            <title>Web Container Home Directory</title>

            <para>Before building and deploying the web service and its
            client, the home directory of the web container must be set either
            as an environment variable or as a property in the respective

                <para>Assuming that you are running from the command-line, it
                is probably simplest to set the appropriate environment
                variable indicating the web container's "home" directory. For
                GlassFish, <literal>AS_HOME</literal> should be set to the
                top-level directory of the GlassFish installation. For Tomcat,
                <literal>CATALINA_HOME</literal> needs to be set to the Tomcat
                top-level directory.</para>

                <para>If you would rather not have to set the environment
                variable for each new terminal session, you can edit the
                <literal>build.xml</literal> file located at the top-level
                directory of each of the examples. There are two commented
                lines, one each for GlassFish (<literal>as.home</literal>) and
                Tomcat (<literal>catalina.home</literal>). Simply uncomment
                the appropriate line and edit the value for the directory
                name.</para>

        <title>Building a JAX-WS Web Service</title>

        <section>
            <title>Starting from Java</title>

            <para>One way to create a web service application is to start by
            coding the endpoint in Java. If you are developing your Java web
            service from scratch or have an existing Java class you wish to
            expose as a web service, this is the most direct path.</para>

            <para>The web service is written as a normal Java class. Then the
            class and its methods that are to be exposed are annotated with
            specific web service annotations, <literal>@WebService</literal>
            and <literal>@WebMethod</literal>. The following code snippet
            shows an example:</para>

            <programlisting language="java">@WebService
public class AddNumbersImpl {
    @WebMethod
    public int addNumbers(int a, int b) throws AddNumbersException {
        if (a &lt; 0 || b &lt; 0) {
            throw new AddNumbersException("Negative number cant be added!",
                    "Numbers: " + a + ", " + b);
        }
        return a + b;
    }
}</programlisting>

            <para>If you are using GlassFish, the web service in the
            <literal>wsit-jaxws-fromjava</literal> example can be compiled and
            bundled simply by invoking:</para>

            <programlisting>ant server</programlisting>

            <para>If using Tomcat, the command-line would be:</para>

            <programlisting>ant -Duse.tomcat=true server</programlisting>

            <para>The <literal>server</literal> target in
            <literal>build.xml</literal> in turn invokes the tools necessary
            to process the annotations and compile the sources, and to bundle
            the Java class files and configuration files into a deployable web
            archive (WAR file). The WAR file will be
            <literal>build/war/wsit-jaxws-fromjava.war</literal>. The tools
            that were called by ant during this step are briefly described
            next.</para>

            <para>The JAX-WS tool <command>apt</command> (annotation
            processing tool) processes the annotated source code and invokes
            the compiler itself, resulting in the class files for each of the
            Java source files. In the accompanying <literal>fromjava</literal>
            example, the <command>ant</command> target
            <command>build-server-java</command> in
            <literal>build.xml</literal> handles this portion of the process.
            Then the individual class files are bundled together along with
            the web service's supporting configuration files into the
            application's WAR file. It is this file that will be deployed to
            the web container in the next step. The
            <command>create-war</command> target takes care of this.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Starting from WSDL</title>

            <para>Typically, you would start from WSDL to build your web
            service if you want to implement a web service that is already
            defined either by a standard or an existing instance of the
            service. In either case, the WSDL already exists. The JAX-WS
            <command>wsimport</command> tool will process the existing WSDL
            document, either from a local copy on disk or by retrieving it
            from a network address. An example of manually accessing a
            service's WSDL using a web browser is shown below as part of the
            section on verifying deployment.</para>

            <para>As in the previous example, to build the
            <literal>wsit-jaxws-fromwsdl</literal> service for GlassFish, you
            can simply invoke:</para>

            <programlisting>ant server</programlisting>

            <para>Otherwise for Tomcat use:</para>

            <programlisting>ant -Duse.tomcat=true server</programlisting>

            <para><command>wsimport</command> will take the WSDL description
            and generate a corresponding Java interface and other supporting
            classes. Then the Java compiler needs to be called to compile both
            the user's code and the generated code. Finally, the class files
            are bundled together into the WAR file. The details can be seen in
            the <literal>wsit-jaxws-fromwsdl</literal>
            <literal>build.xml</literal> file as the
            <command>build-server-wsdl</command> and
            <command>create-war</command> targets.</para>
        </section>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="basma-deploying">
        <title>Deploying the Web Service to a Web Container</title>

        <para>As a convenience, invoking each sample's
        <command>server</command> target will build that web service's WAR
        file and immediately deploy it to the web container. However, in some
        situations, such as after undeploying a web service from its
        container, it may be useful to deploy the web service without
        rebuilding it.</para>

        <para>For both the <emphasis>from Java</emphasis> and <emphasis>from
        WSDL</emphasis> scenarios described above, the resulting application
        is deployed in the same manner. However, the details of the deployment
        process differ slightly between the GlassFish and Tomcat web
        containers.</para>

        <section>
            <title>Deploying to GlassFish</title>

            <para>For development purposes, it is simplest to use the
            "autodeploy" facility of GlassFish. To do so, copy your
            application's WAR file to the <literal>autodeploy</literal>
            directory for the domain to which you want to deploy. If you are
            using the default domain, <literal>domain1</literal>, set up by
            the GlassFish installation process, then the appropriate directory
            path would be
            <literal>&lt;glassfish-install-home&gt;/domains/domain1/autodeploy</literal>.</para>

            <para>The <literal>build.xml</literal> file which accompanies this
            example has a deploy target for GlassFish. Invoke that target by
            running <command>ant</command> in the top-level directory of the
            respective examples, either <literal>fromjava</literal> or
            <literal>fromwsdl</literal>, as follows.</para>

            <programlisting>ant deploy</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Deploying to Tomcat</title>

            <para>Tomcat also has an "autodeploy" feature. That feature can be
            turned off but is enabled by Tomcat’s "out of the box"
            configuration settings. Look in
            <literal>&lt;tomcat-install-directory&gt;/conf/server.xml</literal>
            for the value of "<parameter>autoDeploy</parameter>" if you are
            unsure. Assuming "<parameter>autoDeploy</parameter>" is enabled,
            then copying your application to
            <literal>&lt;tomcat-install-home&gt;/webapps</literal> is all that
            is necessary. Again, there is a target in the
            <command>ant</command> <literal>build.xml</literal> file which
            accompanies this sample. The deploy target can be invoked by
            running the following command in the example's top-level
            directory.</para>

            <programlisting>ant -Duse.tomcat=true deploy</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Verifying Successful Deployment</title>

            <para>One basic test to verify that the application has deployed
            properly is to use a web browser to retrieve the application's
            WSDL from its hosting web container. The following URLs would
            retrieve the WSDL from each of the two example services. If you
            are running your web browser and web container on different
            machines, you will need to replace "localhost" with the name of
            the machine hosting your web service. It is also worth ensuring
            that your web container is actually running at this
            point.<itemizedlist role="document">

    <section xml:id="basma-building-client">
        <title>Building a JAX-WS Web Service Client</title>

        <para>Unlike developing a web service provider, the process for
        creating a web service client application will always start with an
        existing WSDL document. This process is similar to the steps taken
        when building a service from an existing WSDL. Typically, the WSDL
        will be retrieved directly from a web service provider by the
        <command>wsimport</command> tool . Wsimport then generates the
        corresponding Java source code for the described interface.
        <command>javac</command>, the Java compiler, is then called to compile
        the source into class files. The programmer's code uses the generated
        classes to access the web service. Here is an example code
        snippet:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">AddNumbersPortType port = new AddNumbersService().getAddNumbersPort();
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int result = port.addNumbers(a,b);</programlisting>

        <para>For both of the associated examples, invoking</para>

        <programlisting>ant client</programlisting>

        <para>or</para>

        <programlisting>ant -Duse.tomcat=true client</programlisting>

        <para>will run <command>wsimport</command> to retrieve the service's
        WSDL and compile the source.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="basma-running-client">
        <title>Running the Web Service Client</title>

        <para>For both examples, execute the resulting command-line clients
        via</para>

        <programlisting>ant run</programlisting>

        <para>or</para>

        <programlisting>ant -Duse.tomcat=true run</programlisting>

        <para>That target simply runs Java with the name of the client's
        class, such as <command>java
        fromwsdl.client.AddNumbersClient</command>. However, for convenience
        the <command>run</command> target takes care of passing a list of jar
        files via Java's <option>-classpath</option> option. When you invoke
        the <command>run</command> target, you can expect to see output from
        the client similar to the following:</para>

        <para>The <literal>WARNING</literal> line above is expected for both
        of these examples. Given that no Metro technologies are enabled, a
        configuration file is unnecessary. More information will be provided
        on Metro configuration files in the following article.</para>

        <title>Undeploying a JAX-WS Web Service</title>

        <para>Undeploying a web service means to disable &amp; remove it from
        the web container. Clients will no longer be able to use the web
        service nor will the web service restart without explicit redeployment
        by the user. During the development process, it is often useful to
        undeploy a web service. This section explains the necessary steps for
        both GlassFish and Tomcat.</para>

            <title>Undeploying from GlassFish</title>

            <para>The <command>asadmin</command> command provides the simplest
            method of undeploying a web service from GlassFish.</para>

            <title>Undeploying from Tomcat</title>

            <para>Undeploying a given web service from Tomcat requires
            deleting its WAR file from the Tomcat <literal>webapps</literal>
            directory. For a typical UNIX scenario the commands below would
            delete the sample WAR files. Tomcat then automatically undeploys
            the web service within a few seconds.</para>
