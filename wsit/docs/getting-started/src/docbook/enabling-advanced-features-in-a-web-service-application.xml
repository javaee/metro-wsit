        <!--title>Enabling Advanced Features in a Web Service Application</title-->

        <abstract>
            <para>This article highlights the steps required to enable
            Metro-specific advanced functionalities in a web service and its
            corresponding client application. As with the previous article,
            two accompanying code samples are included. Again, one starts from
            Java source code and the other from an existing WSDL document to
            develop their respective web services. However, this article and
            its code samples show how WS-Policy can used to enable
            WS-Addressing and WS-Reliable Messaging in the web services and
            their clients.</para>
        </abstract>
    </info>

    <section>
        <title>Overview</title>

        <para>Supporting code samples are included to demonstrate building a
        web service using WSIT functionality. The examples show how to develop
        a web service both starting from Java source code and starting from an
        existing WSDL document. For both cases, it shows how to develop a
        corresponding client application from the web service's WSDL document.
        The examples can be found in the WSIT source tree here:</para>

        <itemizedlist role="package">
            <listitem>
                <para><link
                xlink:href="download/wsit-enabled-fromjava.zip">From-Java
                example</link></para>

            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>As you follow along with the sample code, please confirm that
        you are working in either <literal>wsit-enabled-fromjava</literal> or
        <literal>wsit-enabled-fromwsdl</literal> rather than one of the
        previous article's sample code directories,
        <literal>wsit-jaxws-fromjava</literal> or
        <literal>wsit-jaxws-fromwsdl</literal>.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Prerequisites and Environment Configuration</title>

        <para>As in the previous article, the steps in this document require
        that you have already installed the WSIT jars into your web container.
        It also requires the following software be installed: <link
        xlink:href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">JDK
        6.0 Update 29</link> or later, <link
        xlink:href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant 1.6.5</link> or later,
        and a web container: either <link
        xlink:href="https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/">Glassfish</link> or <link
        xlink:href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat 7.0</link>.
        Further, your Metro build environment needs to be configured as
        described in the <xref linkend="basma-environment"
        xrefstyle="select:title" /> section of the previous article.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>WSIT Configuration and WS-Policy</title>

        <para>Advanced web service features are enabled and configured using a
        mechanism defined by the <link
        xlink:href="http://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/09/policy/">Web Services
        Policy Framework</link> (WS-Policy) specification. A web service
        expresses its requirements and capabilities via policies embedded in
        the service's WSDL description. A service consumer verifies it can
        handle the expressed requirements and, optionally, uses server
        capabilities advertised in policies.</para>

        <para>Technologies like Reliable Messaging, Addressing, or Secure
        Conversations, provides a set of policy assertions it can process.
        Those assertions provide the necessary configuration details to the
        Metro run-time to enable proper operation of these features used by a
        given web service. The assertions may specify particular configuration
        settings or rely on default settings that are pre-determined by the
        specific technology. For instance, in the snippet shown below,
        <literal>wsrm:AcknowledgementInterval</literal> and
        <literal>wsrm:InactivityTimeout</literal> are both optional and could
        be omitted. The following is an XML snippet showing WS-Policy
        assertions for WS-Addressing and WS-Reliable Messaging:</para>

        <programlisting language="xml">&lt;wsp:Policy wsu:Id="AddNumbers_policy"&gt;
  &lt;wsp:ExactlyOne&gt;
    &lt;wsp:All&gt;
      &lt;wsam:Addressing wsp:Optional="false"/&gt;
      &lt;wsrm:RMAssertion&gt;
        &lt;wsrm:InactivityTimeout Milliseconds="600000"/&gt;
        &lt;wsrm:AcknowledgementInterval Milliseconds="200"/&gt;
      &lt;/wsrm:RMAssertion&gt;
    &lt;/wsp:All&gt;
  &lt;/wsp:ExactlyOne&gt;
&lt;/wsp:Policy&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>This snippet would be equally valid in either a WSIT
        configuration file or a web service's WSDL document.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Configuring WSIT in the Web Service</title>

        <section>
            <title>Starting from Java</title>

            <para>When developing a web service from scratch or based on an
            existing Java class, WSIT features are enabled using a
            configuration file. That file,
            <literal>wsit-fromjava.server.AddNumberImpl.xml</literal>, is
            written in WSDL format. An example configuration file can be found
            in the accompanying samples:</para>

            <itemizedlist role="document">
                <listitem>
                    <para><link
                    xlink:href="samples/wsit-enabled-fromjava/etc/wsit-fromjava.server.AddNumbersImpl.xml">wsit-enabled-fromjava/etc/wsit-fromjava.server.AddNumbersImpl.xml</link></para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>The configuration file settings will be incorporated
            dynamically by the WSIT run-time into the WSDL it generates for
            the web service. So when a client requests the service's WSDL, the
            run-time will embed into the WSDL any publically visible policy
            assertions contained in the configuration file. For the example
            link above, the Addressing and Reliable Messsaging assertions
            would be part of the WSDL as seen by the client.</para>

            <note>
                <para><literal>wsit.xml</literal> must be in the
                <literal>WEB-INF</literal> sub-directories of the
                application's WAR file when it is deployed to the web
                container. Otherwise, the WSIT run-time environment will not
                find it.</para>
            </note>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Starting from WSDL</title>

            <para>When developing a web service starting from an existing
            WSDL, the situation is actually simpler. The policy assertions
            needed to enable various WSIT technologies will already be
            embedded in the WSDL document. Here is an example WSDL document in
            the accompanying samples:</para>

            <itemizedlist role="document">
                <listitem>
                    <para><link
                    xlink:href="samples/wsit-enabled-fromwsdl/etc/AddNumbers.wsdl">wsit-enabled-fromwsdl/etc/AddNumbers.wsdl</link></para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </section>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Building and Deploying the Web Service</title>

        <para>Once configured, a WSIT-enabled web service is built and
        deployed in the same manner as a standard JAX-WS web service. If you
        are not familiar with those steps, please review the following
        sections from <xref linkend="building-a-simple-metro-application"
        xrefstyle="select:title" />: <xref linkend="basma-building"
        xrefstyle="select:title" /> and <xref linkend="basma-deploying"
        xrefstyle="select:title" />. However, the URLs needed to verify the
        respective web services differ from the previous article's examples
        and are listed below:</para>

        <itemizedlist role="document">
            <listitem>
                <para><link
                xlink:href="http://localhost:8080/wsit-enabled-fromjava/addnumbers?wsdl">http://localhost:8080/wsit-enabled-fromjava/addnumbers?wsdl</link></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para><link
                xlink:href="http://localhost:8080/wsit-enabled-fromwsdl/addnumbers?wsdl">http://localhost:8080/wsit-enabled-fromwsdl/addnumbers?wsdl</link></para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Configuring WSIT in the Web Service Client</title>

        <para>Client-side configuration of WSIT functionality is largely
        automatic in the WSIT environment. The WSDL document seen by the
        client will already contain the WSIT policy assertions. Those
        assertions describe any requirements from the server as well as any
        optional features the client may use. The WSIT build tools and
        run-time environment will detect the WSDL's policy assertions and
        configure themselves appropriately, if possible. If an unsupported
        assertion is found, an error message describing the problem will be
        displayed.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Building and Running a Web Service Client</title>

        <para>As with the web service itself, building and running a
        WSIT-enabled client application is identical to running a standard
        JAX-WS client application. Those steps are described in the following
        sections of the previous article: <xref
        linkend="basma-building-client" xrefstyle="select:title" /> and <xref
        linkend="basma-running-client" xrefstyle="select:title" />. You can
        expect to see output from the client similar to the following:</para>

        <programlisting>[java] Invoking addNumbers(10, 20)

        <title>Undeploying a Web Service</title>

        <para>As described in <xref linkend="basma-undeploying"
        xrefstyle="select:title" />, to undeploy a web service means to both
        disable and remove it from the web container. This section provides
        the necessary commands to undeploy this article's sample web services
        from both GlassFish and Tomcat.</para>
