    <name>Woodstox OSGi implementation bundle for GlassFish V3</name>

    <description>
        This module is exclusively meant for use in GlassFish V3 development. It
        is highly unlikely to work in any other environment. If you are looking
        for a OSGi implementation of Woodstox, please consider Woodstox 4.0.
