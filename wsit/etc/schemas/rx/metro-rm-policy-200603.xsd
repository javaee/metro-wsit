                 Messages from each individual Sequence are to be delivered in the
                 same order they have been sent by the Application Source. The
                 requirement on an RM Source is that it MUST ensure that the ordinal
                 position of each message in the Sequence (as indicated by a message
                 Sequence number) is consistent with the order in which the messages
                 have been sent from the Application Source. The requirement on the
                 RM Destination is that it MUST deliver received messages for each
                 Sequence in the order indicated by the message numbering. This
                 DeliveryAssurance can be used in combination with any of the AtLeastOnce,
                 AtMostOnce or ExactlyOnce assertions, and the requirements of those
                 assertions MUST also be met. In particular if the AtLeastOnce or
                 ExactlyOnce assertion applies and the RM Destination detects a gap
                 in the Sequence then the RM Destination MUST NOT deliver any subsequent
                 messages from that Sequence until the missing messages are received
                 or until the Sequence is closed.

                Each message is to be delivered at least once, or else an error MUST
                be raised by the RM Source and/or RM Destination. The requirement
                on an RM Source is that it SHOULD retry transmission of every message
                sent by the Application Source until it receives an acknowledgement
                from the RM Destination. The requirement on the RM Destination is
                that it SHOULD retry the transfer to the Application Destination
                of any message that it accepts from the RM Source, until that message
                has been successfully delivered. There is no requirement for the
                RM Destination to apply duplicate message filtering.
