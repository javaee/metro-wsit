                        A message is considered to be transferred if its delivery at the recipient
                        has been acknowledged by the recipient.

                        If an acknowledgment has not been received within a certain amount of time
                        for a message that has been transmitted, the infrastructure automatically
                        retransmits the message. The infrastructure tries to send the message for
                        at most the configured number of times. Not receiving an acknowledgment
                        before this limit is reached is considered a fatal communication failure,
                        and causes the RM session failure.

                        The infrastructure uses the configured back-off algorithm to determine when
                        to retransmit, based on a configured base retransmission time.

                By default, the call to proxy.close() will not return until all
                messages have been acknowledged. RM close timeout is the interval
                (in milliseconds) that the client runtime will block waiting for
                a call to close() to return. If there are still unacknowledged
                messages after this interval is reached, and the call to close
                has returned, an error will be logged about messages being lost.

                Specifies the period (in milliseconds) of a sequence maintenance
